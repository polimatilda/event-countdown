Homework project - Events with countdown

- simple angular app, where you can add events with due dates
- events show in a list with a countdown
- use json-server package & observables
- add new events with a short form
- minimal style (with Bootstrap)
- filters out the event where the countdown reached 0

- Login branch:
  - dummy login component (login available at /login)
  - username: username, password: password
  - redirects to dashboard
  - login is not stored yet, so daschboard is available without login
